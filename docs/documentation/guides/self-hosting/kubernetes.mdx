title: "Deploy to Kubernetes"
description: "Deploy self hosted version of [Trigger.dev](https://trigger.dev) to your kubernetes cluster using our helm chart"
---
**Prerequisites**
- You have understanding of [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
- Installed [Helm package manager](https://helm.sh/) version v3.11.3 or greater
- You have [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kubectl/) installed and connected to your kubernetes cluster

By deploying Trigger.dev on Kubernetes, you can take advantage of its features to ensure that the application is fault-tolerant, highly available, and scalable.
To make the installation process easier and more streamlined, we have created a Helm chart that you can use to install Trigger.dev on Kubernetes. 

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the installation and management of Kubernetes applications. 
With our Helm chart, you can easily install Trigger.dev on Kubernetes, configure it to your liking, and scale it up or down as needed. 

## Install Trigger.dev Helm repository 

```bash
TODO: Add helm repo to artifact hub or cloudsmith
```

## Add Helm values 

Create a values.yaml file to configure various installation settings, such as the docker image tags and environment variables. To explore all configurable properties for your values file, [visit this page](TODO: add this).

#### Set image tags

By default, the application will use the latest tag to retrieve the required Docker images, which may be appropriate for most cases. 
However, we recommend that you use a specific version of the Docker image to avoid unexpected changes to the application.

<Tip>
  To find the latest version number of Trigger.dev, follow the link below 
  - [Trigger.dev image on github packaes](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/trigger.dev/pkgs/container/trigger.dev) 
</Tip>

```yaml simple-values-example.yaml 
trigger:
  name: trigger
  replicaCount: 2
  image:
    repository: ghcr.io/triggerdotdev/trigger.dev
    tag: "latest" # <--- frontend version 
    pullPolicy: Always
```

#### Configure environment variables

You can configure environment variables for trigger in your Helm values file under the property `envVars`. View configurable [environment variables](../configuration/envars).

Infisical requires the following backend environment variables to be defined: _`MAGIC_LINK_SECRET`_, _`SESSION_SECRET`_, _`ENCRYPTION_KEY`_, _`DIRECT_URL`_, and _`DATABASE_URL`_ . 

However, when the above environment variables are not defined, the Helm chart 
will automatically generate these environment variables for you. The generated environment variables will be saved to a Kubernetes secret and will be preserved between upgrades or uninstalls. 

```yaml simple-values-example.yaml 
...
envVars:
  ENCRYPTION_KEY: "b1ebe43a6a6e24b2aa8fa0707d3890e3"
  MAGIC_LINK_SECRET: "842727396bcee22da68518f959c5730b"
  ...
```
